This manual contains directions for performing a kinetic simulation mimicking a T-jump experiment. The scripts as
given here utilize a custom ODE-solver named PPODESUITE, which should be installed on a Linux system (in our case, 
Linux Mint 17 was used). The scripts should be copied to such a system, and functions of each script are detailed below. 

KineticSimulationTJump_TP.m initiates kinetic simulations using the two-pathway kinetic model. The ODEs corresponding to 
this model are supplied as a Matlab-file gTP.m, in a specific format. This file is translated to a Fortran definition of 
the ODE-system, which is then accessed through the Matlab MEX interface in PPODESUITE. The kinetic and thermodynamic 
parameters for the simulation need to be inserted manually into KineticSimulationTJump_TP.m. With these parameters, the
script calculates the initial distribution of molecules (using TwoPathwayTherm.m and TwoPathwayTherm_func.m). From this
initial distribution, the kinetic simulation is started and all molecular distributions are followed as a function of time. 
After convergence of this simulation, several plots of these distributions are made using plotting scripts tfracphiloglogplot.m,
tncnucloglogcontourf.m and tnphinucloglogcontourf.m. These scripts rely on dependent scripts monoToDistribution.m and 
speciesToFractions.m to convert the concentration of individual species to mole fractions of particular states.
