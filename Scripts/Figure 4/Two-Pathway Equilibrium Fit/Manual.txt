This manual contains directions for performing a thermodynamic parameter optimization routine using Matlab. 
The routine entails three steps, explained in detail below. The required scripts are located in 
corresponding folders, and require knowledge of Matlab to operate or adapt. Depending on the sample
size, step 2 can be quite cumbersome and as such is usually parallellized on multiple cores. 

N.B.: The two-pathway optimization was performed before the single-pathway version chronologically, and as 
such contains minor implementational differences. 

1. Generating Initial Parameters
	Running GenerateStartingParams_TP, an initial parameter set is generated.

2. Solving Mass Balances in Parallel
	These scripts (InitiateVariableTemperatureFit_TP.m, SolveMassBalance_TP.m and MassBalanceExpression_TP.m)
	contain routines to fit spectral response predicted by the competitive two-pathway model 
	to the experimental spectra, starting from the parameter values generated in Step 1. After running 
	InitiateVariableTemperatureFit_TP.m, output files for different initial parameter values are stored. 

3. Find Best Solution
	Running ThermodynamicFitSorter_TP.m sorts the output files from the fit according. Subsequently, 
	running AnalyzerThermodynamicFit_TP.m will identify the best fit, and plot overlays of this fit 
	with the data. Additionally, it can be used to create a pseudo-phase diagram.
