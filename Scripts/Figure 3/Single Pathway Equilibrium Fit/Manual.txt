This manual contains directions for performing a thermodynamic parameter optimization routine using Matlab. 
The routine entails three steps, explained in detail below. The required scripts are located in 
corresponding folders, and require knowledge of Matlab to operate or adapt. Depending on the sample
size, step 2 can be quite cumbersome and as such is usually parallellized on multiple cores. 

1. Generating Initial Parameters
	Running GenerateStartingParams_SP.m on one processor, an initial parameter set is generated, and split up 
	into separate matrices for use on different cores. 

2. Solving Mass Balances in Parallel
	These scripts (InitiateVariableTemperatureFit_SP.m, SolveMassBalance_SP.m and MassBalanceExpression_SP.m)
	are to be duplicated on every core along with the spectroscopic data and the corresponding starting
	parameter matrix. The scripts contain routines to fit spectral response predicted by the single-pathway model 
	to the experimental spectra, starting from the parameter values generated in Step 1. After running 
	InitiateVariableTemperatureFit_SP.m on every core, output files for different nucleus sizes and initial 
	parameter values are stored. 

3. Find Best Solution
	Running ThermodynamicFitSorter_SP.m on one processor again sorts the output files from the fit according 
	to nucleus size. Subsequently, running AnalyzerThermodynamicFit_SP.m will identify the best fit for each 
	nucleus size, and plot overlays of this fit with the data. Additionally, it can be used to create a pseudo 
	phase diagram.
