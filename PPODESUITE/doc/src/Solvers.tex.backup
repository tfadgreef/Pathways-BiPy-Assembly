\chapter{Solvers}
\section{Introduction}
The solver for the ODE problem can be specified using the 'Solver' option of the \sourceword{PPODE\_build} function:
\matlabcmd{PPODE\_build('source.F', 'target', 'Solver', \ph{Solver Name})}
Valid options for \ph{Solver Name} are:
\begin{description}
 \item['Stiff' (or 'BDF')] The BDF based solver of the LSODE package. \emph{See \ref{subsec:LSODEBDF}}.
 \item['MEBDFSO' (or 'BDFSparse')] The modified BDF based solver using a sparse Jacobian matrix. \emph{See \ref{subsec:MEBDFSO}}.
 \item['Non-Stiff' (or 'Adams-Moulton')] The Adams-Moulton based solver of the LSODE package. \emph{See \ref{subsec:LSODEAM}}.
 \item['RK23', 'RK45', 'RK78'] The Runge-Kutta based solvers of the RKSUITE package. \emph{See \ref{subsec:RKSUITE}}.
 \item['Switching' (or 'LSODA')] The solver that switches between the non-stiff Adams-Moulton based solver and the stiff BDF based solver of the LSODE package. \emph{See \ref{subsec:LSODA}}.
\end{description}

If you do not know which solver to choose, but you already know which \MATLAB solver performs best, table \ref{tab:MATLABToPPODE} might be helpfull.

\section{Stiff}
\subsection{BDF}
\label{subsec:LSODEBDF}
The Backward Differential Formulas based method uses the BDF implementation that ODEPACK supplies. The order of these formulae can range between 1 and 5 and can be limited by setting the 'MaxOrder' option when building the ODE system.

\subsection{Modified Extended BDF using Sparse Jacobian}
\label{subsec:MEBDFSO}
The Modified Extended Backward Differential Formulae based method uses the BDF implementation that MEBDFSO supplies. The order of these formulas can range between 1 and 5 and can be limited by setting the 'MaxOrder' option when building the ODE system.

\section{Non-Stiff}
\subsection{Adams-Moulton}
\label{subsec:LSODEAM}
The Adams-Moulton method based solver uses the Adams-Moulton implementation that LSODE supplies. The order of these formulae can range between 1 and 12 and can be limited by setting the 'MaxOrder' option when building the ODE system.
\subsection{Runge-Kutta}
\label{subsec:RKSUITE}
The Runga-Kutta methods based solver uses the RKSUITE package. Three Runge-Kutta pairs are available: 2-3, 4-5 and 7-8. Use higher orders in combination with smaller tolerances. 
\section{Mixed}
\subsection{Switching between BDF and Adams-Moulton}
\label{subsec:LSODA}
The switching method uses the LSODA subroutine that the LSODE package supplies. This method automatically switches between the BDF based stiff solver (order 1-5) and the Adams-Moulton method based non-stiff solver (order 1-12).
