/*!
 * This data structure consists of nodes that specify their neighbours.
 * Each node has a left neighbour, right neighbour, parent and children,
 * resulting in a structure like this:
\verbatim
node-1
  |-> node-1.1
  |-> node-1.2 
\endverbatim
 * Where node-1 has no neighbours, but two Node#children: node-1.1 and 
 * node-1.2. node-1.1 is positioned Node#previous of node-1.2, whereas 
 * node-1.2 is the Node#next node relative to node-1.1. Both node-1.1 
 * and node-1.2 have node-1 as Node#parent.
 * 
 * Each node also has a Node#tag, defining the type of the node.
 * Examples of tags are ::TPLUS and ::TMUL, specifying a plus (+) or
 * multiplication (*) operation respectively.
 * 
 * If the node specifies a number (i.e. the tag is ::TNUM),
 * Node#ival will hold the value of this number. Every number is 
 * interpreted as a double precision number, since Matlab does not
 * really distinguishes between integers and floating point numbers 
 * either.
 *
 * The Node#iname property can be used in combination with the ::TVAR,
 * ::TARRAYINDEX or ::TFOR tags to specify the name of the identifier used.
 * 
 * The Node#ignore property can be used to ignore Matlab specific
 * assignments that should not be translated to Fortran code.
 * 
 * @sa copyNode, removeNode, createOperation, createConstant,
 *     createVariable, appendChild, print_tree
